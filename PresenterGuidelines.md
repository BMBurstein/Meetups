# Core C++ User Group: Presenter Guidelines
The goal of this document is to provide hints for the best video recording in the meetups (and not a general presenter's guidelines).

## Slides Preparation
In the current meetup locations there are LCD displays installed, so there's no need to optimize the color palette to projector.

## Timing
- Each session is scheduled for certain duration, please stick to this time limit, to allow next presenters to get their full time slot
- Leave couple of minutes for questions
- We will be showing signs with remaining time as the limit will be approaching

## Session Recording
- We always ask whether you consent for the session to be recorded and shared on YouTube
- During the session we record both the screen capture and a live video
- The video is recorded with a static camera, with a limited field of view. The area which is visible to the camera will be marked with a tape stripes on the floor, please try to stay within the borders during your talk.
- The voice is recorded using a stationary mic, the best sound is produced when you speak in the direction of the audience
- It's recommended not to point by hand at the projected slide, but use a mouse/other pointing device, so is will get recorded as well
- We capture the presentation on the 2nd (extended) display of the laptop. 
  - Please don't change display settings to "duplicate" screen during the recording (let us know in advance in case such mode is needed)
  - To move a window from the main to extended screen press ["Windows" + "Shift" + "->"] (or just drag it with mouse)
