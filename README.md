## Code of Conduct
Core C++ abides by the [Berlin Code of Conduct](http://berlincodeofconduct.org/).

## We Want Your Talk!
We'd like *you* to present at Core C++!  
Wanna give a talk, or perhaps lead some other type of session, at a future Core C++ meet-up?
Great! Thanks! We're a product of the community, so we need people from all backgrounds to take their turn at the front.
Traditional talks - of all sorts of lengths - are always welcome, but we're also interested in different format and activities (discussions, games, workshops etc).

Please fill in [**this form**](https://t.co/pvP6WE2vpl) to get the ball rolling!
